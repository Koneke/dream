# Thing
This pretty much just takes my weird, blockbased syntax and turns it into HTML. Probably not robust at all, to be honest. Uses forbiddenfruit (https://github.com/clarete/forbiddenfruit) and lambdatools (which is just my own set of "I'm lazy" things). As always, nothing guaranteed to work or whatever, and I take no responsibility for harm done to your person, computer or other belongings. Fly safe.
